# SuperString
In the shortest common superstring problem (SCSP) one receives as the input a finite collection of words S[0],S[1]..,S[n-1] and the challenge is to find the shortest string Solution which contains all S[i], for all i=0,..,n-1, as substrings. 
Example: Assume the input strings are S[0]=abaa, S[1]=baaa, and S[2]=aaaab. 
A string aaaabaaa (of length 8) is a superstring of S[0], S[1], and S[2], however there is a shorter superstring abaaaab (of length 7) which is a better candidate for the shortest super string. 

In the first two instances (SuperString1.java and SuperString2.java) the input strings are fixed
In the third instance (SuperString3.java) during every execution of the code the content of the input strings is drawn at random.

Algorithm was created to identify the shortest string possible.
